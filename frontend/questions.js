/*
5. Explain various hooks in functional component (at least 5)

useState - allows functional components to manage state. You can declare state variables and update them using the provided setter function.

useEffect - is used for handling side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

useRef - is used to create mutable ref objects that can persist across renders and don't cause re-renders when changed.

useSelector -  is a hook provided by the Redux library's React bindings (often used with react-redux). It allows you to extract data from the Redux store and use it in your component.

useDispatch -  is another hook provided by the Redux library's React bindings (react-redux). It allows you to access the dispatch function, which is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store.

useParams - is a hook provided by React Router, specifically react-router-dom. It allows you to access the parameters from the current URL.

useNavigate - is a hook provided by React Router for programmatic navigation. It allows you to programmatically navigate to different routes within your application.
